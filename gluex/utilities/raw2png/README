Here are two program for converting the "images.raw" file into
PNG image files for easy viewing of track images. The intent
is to provide a few sample PNG files for humans to look at.
For ML applications, it is more efficient to use a single
file with just the image data.

You probably want the python script instead of the compiled
C++ program since it can read a gzipped file directly.
